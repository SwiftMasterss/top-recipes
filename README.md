Recipes-Website Project

Hi, currently i am learning web-development with the help of The Odin Project. The Odin Project is a Website, which leads you step by step into the world of web development. The Odin Project is an OpenSource Project and it is completely free. If you are interested in The Odin Project feel free to visit their website: https://www.theodinproject.com


This repository is created, for a recipes website, which will be developed as i walk through The Odin Project.
