    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pelmeni is a traditional Russian dish that consists of small dumplings filled with meat, typically beef, pork, or a combination of both.</p>
    <p>To make pelmeni, a simple dough is rolled out and cut into small circles, then filled with a seasoned meat mixture and formed into small, sealed dumplings.</p>
    <p>Pelmeni can be boiled or fried and are often served with sour cream, butter, or a vinegar-based sauce for added flavor. They are a popular comfort food in Russia and are enjoyed by many around the world.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Ground beef and/or ground pork</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Dill</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Add the water and knead until a smooth dough forms. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: In a separate bowl, combine the ground beef and/or pork with the onion, garlic, salt, pepper, egg, and optional parsley or dill.</li>
        <li>Form the pelmeni: Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut into small circles using a glass or round cookie cutter. Place a teaspoon of filling in the center of each circle and fold the edges of the dough around the filling to create small sealed pockets.</li>
        <li>Cook the pelmeni: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the pelmeni to the boiling water and cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface and the meat is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Serve the pelmeni: Use a slotted spoon to remove the pelmeni from the water and place them on serving plates. Serve with sour cream or a vinegar-based sauce, and garnish with additional parsley or dill, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your homemade pelmeni!</p>
